"""
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day,
and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like,
but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously
(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Â 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6


## Solution



Decisions:
- Buy: -prices[i] + f(i+1, holding=True), if holding=False
- Sell: +prices[i] - fee + f(i+1, holding=False), if holding=True
- Skip: f(i+1, holding)

f(i) = max(buy, sell, skip)

Base case: i > len(prices)
